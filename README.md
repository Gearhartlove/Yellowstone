# yellowstone 

A simple scripting language inspired by Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/). The goal of this project was to write a virtual machine using Rust and investigate programming language design. Over the course of 16 weeks, 4523 lines were written, 80 tests were passed, and basic language features were implemented. These features include: 
* if, else, while statements
* local, global variables
* scopes
* logical operations (<, >, <=, >=, etc...)
* mathematical operations

# WARNING 
Although many language features work, the purpose of this programming language is designed to be educational. It is still in very early stages of development, and parts of code may not function as expected. Documentation is sparse. Please do not attempt to write any serious programs in yellowstone unless you are prepared for many bugs.
